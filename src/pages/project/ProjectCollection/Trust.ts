			'Trust in authorities and institutions is failing — from government, to journalism, to science and medicine and, ultimately, the financial system at the heart of our everyday lives. At a time when no one can agree on anything, *this* is the crisis everyone knows is happening. ',
			'But *why* is it happening? For interviewee **Martin Gurri,** retired CIA analyst and author of *The Revolt Of The Public,* it’s tied up with the rise of digital networks — networks which have given publics around the world the ability to interrogate the narratives handed down by the elites, and the ability to propagate powerful new [narratives](http://narratives.It) of their own. ',
			'This is causing what interviewee **Troy Cross** (Professor of Philosophy at Reed College, epistemologist, Bitcoiner) calls an ‘epistemic crisis’ — a thorough breakdown in our basic tools for knowing and navigating our world. It’s a crisis that’s tearing through democracies everywhere, creating a world that’s increasingly chaotic, dangerous and unstable. The viability of modern democracy and its institutions, **Martin Gurri** argues, seems to have been intertwined with the old top-down, broadcast, one-to-many mode of information. As we continue to move beyond this model, the crisis of trust will accelerate, tearing through any institution which was previously premised on what you could call the ‘top down privilege’.  (Central banks will not be spared: more than anything, money depends on trusted central authority.)',
			'Having reviewed and recognised the gravity of this crisis in its first part, TRUST then goes on to ask: what does the world after epistemic breakdown look like? Which key players have understood the scale of the crisis and are planning for this world? **Izabella Kaminska**, a former editor at *The Financial Times*, shows us two opposing ideas of the future, both seeds of radically different potential worlds.',
			'On one side, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) which swap trust for control  — the bank will literally live in your pocket, observing your every interaction, and (where ‘necessary’) preventing you from engaging in unsanctioned actions, or nudging you towards sanctioned ones. In this vision CBDCs replace cash entirely creating a closed control system with no outside or ‘escape hatch’ — it doesn’t matter if you don’t trust the system, because there is no way to leave; and the elites no longer need to obtain your consent, because they now have the potential to exert direct control over your actions. ',
			'On the other side is Bitcoin. Conceived in 2008, as trust in the world\'s financial institutions hit a crisis point, Bitcoin is also designed to operate without the need for trust - but in an opt-in way that protects individuals, not elites, and doesn’t need to trap everyone inside its system in order to work. Bitcoin is based on cryptographic methods designed as far back as World War One, for spies operating in an environment in which nothing and no one could be [trusted.](http://trusted.It) Its components —  as explained in interviews with **Whit Diffie** and **Adam Back** — were developed by early computer scientists who saw in the earliest digital networks the possibilty for massive surveillance systems — from which they thought cryptography could offer some protection and respite. Having largely rejected private communications as a consumer good, will the general public now embrace a money which respects and extends their privacy?',
			'We are now at a crossroads, with two radically different and even competing visions of how to solve the breakdown of trust. Having explored where CBDCs might takes us, the final part of this project accompanies **Alex Gladstein (Human Rights Foundation)** to visit two or three locations in which trust in governments and banks has already failed, and where people are incorporating Bitcoin in their development new economies. With **Block/TBD’s Mike Brock** we follow a company attempting to build a new vision for a decentralised Web around Bitcoin. And with **Jeff Booth** (*The Price Of Tomorrow*) we discover how Bitcoin could help deal with the radical uncertainty which has permeated economic and cultural life- as what Troy Cross calls an “Archimedean point of certainty” for a radically uncertain world.',

			'The project is largely structured around ‘major’ three day interviews, e.g. with Martin Gurri, Troy Cross, Izabella Kaminska and Jeff Booth. In each of these, a third of the time is spent gathering biographical material, which will be presented in both re-creation, animated archive and straight-to-camera exposition.  Where possible, details of the subject’s life are linked to the analytical material — for example Martin Gurri is a Cuban exile, and time is spent discussing the importance of Che Guevera’s pirate radio in bringing him the message of the Cuban revolutionaries. The aim is to merge biographical narrative with the key themes of the film.',
			'The smaller interviews have little or no biographical excursions and are simply informative talking heads. However the presentation of these introduces the director as a character, as we see him ‘making calls’ to the interviewees about the key topics of the film, apparently within the edit process itself. This ‘fourth-wall’ breaking gives the director the chance to introduce personal biographical narrative into the film, and speaks to the notion of trust that is the project’s overarching topic. This also contextualises the director’s voiceover, around which the project takes shape. ',
			'Recreations are to be kept simple and largely abstract / metaphorical, rather than involving large numbers of actors, sets et cetera. ',
			'We have budgeted for fairly significant use of historical archive, some of which we hope to scan ourselves at the Computer History Museum in Palo Alto. In addition we will explore Fair Use where, for example, interviewees refer to motion pictures which we would be unable to clear.',

			'We\'re living through an accelerating decline of trust in institutions and authority. The entities we rely on to help us navigate crisis are now in crisis themselves. What has become clear to me in the early interviews for TRUST is the degree to which modern democracy was premised on the capacity to own and operate broadcast media - to ‘manufacture consent’, as Chomsky put it. ',
			'This is truly unknown territory: we have never faced a time of such intense change without institutions we can rely on to guide us, and there is no indication that trust will return to the system via censorship, algorithmic filtering, deprioritising content, *et cetera*. ',
			'It is this context that I think a crucial new role for Bitcoin is emerging -- not just as \'hard money\' that can survive through a fiscal disaster, but as a decentralised point of certainty  a financial ‘numeraire’ and a simple, reliable yardstick against which our chaotic world can measure itself.  This is not yet a commonly expressed thesis, but I think it will become an important one in the next few years.',
			'I am a filmmaker and artist with a long history of engagement in decentralised, peer to peer and self-organising systems. My STEAL THIS FILM series offered a new perspective on P2P filesharing as an emergent platform for digital creativity, and successfully predicted a new generation of creators who would thrive in an environment of networked, freely shared content. ',
			'It\'s in this same way I now see Bitcoin, whose status has shifted from marginal to speculative to becoming national tender in some early-adopter countries. The internet conferred the ability to take control of our own content and expression — a transformation whose disruptive effects we\'re tracing in this project.  For me, Bitcoin could be the next stage in that evolution — the emergence of a new kind of networked order which does not require a top-down authority, and requires a new kind of political thinking. ',
			'Is Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer money based on systems secure enough to protect nuclear weapons, now ready to take center stage in a world in the throes of another crisis of trust?',
