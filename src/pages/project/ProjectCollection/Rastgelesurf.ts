			'Our goal is to join the ranks of Bitcoin Beach El Zonte, the_surfer_kids, Bitcoin Lake and Bitcoin Jungle. Turkey has a very brief history (12 years) of wave surfing. Even though Black Sea is very suitable for wave surfing, riptides were feared by the population living on the Black Sea shores. Turkey being a peninsula and having shores on the Mediterranean, Aegean and the Black Sea has a lot of potential to grow the sport. Wave surfing federation is still being established and as Rastgele Surf we want to lead future surf schools and set an example of creating Bitcoin and surfing communities in Turkey.',
