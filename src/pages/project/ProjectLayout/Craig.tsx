		'The Bitcoin Game started as an educational activity to explain Bitcoin in a simple, easy-to-understand, and hands-on way. As a life-long educator, I knew that teaching Bitcoin to precoiners needed to be broken down into a tactile activity that abstracted the technological complexities away in favor of terms anyone can understand. I did this educational activity with meetup groups, family members, and children as young as 5. Each time afterwards, I received feedback that the participants finally had a basic understanding of how Bitcoin works. I wanted to spread this activity to as many people as possible and realized it would be best done as a game. The Bitcoin Game is what evolved from that activity.',
		'The original activity has gone through many adaptations to become what you are helping launch today. It is quite different from the lesson I created at first, but the end result is still the same: players will learn about the complexities of Bitcoin in a simple, easy-to-understand, and intuitive way. Some of the concepts include: mining (hashing/target), block reward, halving, difficulty adjustments, mining pools, the importance of running a node and owning a hardware wallet/signing device, bitcoin gaining value over time, and more! Thereâ€™s even some Bitcoin memes in there for fun. I can guarantee the educational goal is accomplished and my hope is for the secondary goal to be too: players having fun learning about the Bitcoin Network, invest bitcoin as wisely as possible, and lower their time preference by strategizing to create a better world in the future.',
